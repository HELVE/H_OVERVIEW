**HELVE ᴀᴠʀ** is a 2+ years in the making multispecialist creative entity, which has been a personal way to clarify who I am and what I strive for in life. Helve Operatives are a specialized group of creatives (world summoners, designers, videographers, musicians, game makers, writers) experimenting with advanced technology and creating new ways of expression in various tech and content outputs. 

As an independent creative taskforce we operate between the borders of creative industry and conceptual freedom of anarchy. Analyzed experimentation is our preferred approach to problems and a form of expression alike. 

As a business Helve ᴀᴠʀ aims to provide a variety of services from video and live production to interactive audiovisual installations for brands and dark moon brand creation itself (*brands inherently rebellious in nature, trying to change the status quo, with preference for persistent small experimental steps and the philosophy that quantity creates quality* - read more about [Helve ᴀᴠʀ Agency Source Code](#sourcecode) below).

The reason Helve ᴀᴠʀ exists is to create not only new ways of expression for us as artists and crafters but also to provide new future environments and ways of communication both in real life as well as in mixed reality experiences - our core drive is to **visually hack the world** and promote being creative and proactive with one's life by showcasing the process of making something and potentially inspiring others to create nonstandard creative projects - be it a big or small story to tell.

Our agency uses Reinforced Trisight methodology and according to it we base our live creative operations within 3 fields of creativity: Audio, Visual and Research/Interaction. That division works well in conjunction with a project initially created for personal use called [Dopamine Trails](https://github.com/HELVE/DOPAMINETRAILS) (clarifying ones core drives in life, discovering strengths and weaknesses, optimizing lifestyle for creativity) works as a foundation for Helve AVR's operational values and drives.

Helve ᴀᴠʀ has several own brands developed under its wings. Each of the brands represents a range of underlying emotion/motivation related to the main core drive of the agency, which is to vishack the world. 

All brands are implemented by creating specific narrative transmedia universes for each of the brands, often using episodic nature as well as rapid prototyping and behind the scenes approach ([Helve Logs - Live Documentation Series](https://github.com/HELVE/HELVELOGS)).

## Helve Operative Guidelines - Directive Protocols

Directive protocols act as a basis for behavioral priorities and are a direct reflection of the values that Helve creatives try to uplift for the sake of personal development and growth. Every Helve agent/operative in the field initiates and fulfills the protocols as needed or required after a self-realization session. 

Directive Protocols | Type | Notes
------------ | ------------- | -------------
1 **Alpha [α]** | **[Survival]** | **Initiate recovery mode.** <br> Self-preservation is essential. Take care of your physical and mental health as well as finances.
2 **Beta [β]** | **[Knowledge]** | **Initiate clarity mode.** <br> Trust your intuition but reinforce it with learning, tracking and organization. 
3 **Gamma (Γ)** | **[Creativity]** | **Initiate grind mode.** <br> Mission comes first. Relentlessly create things you love.
4 Delta (Δ) | [Communication] | **Initiate direct mode.** <br> When in contact with others pass The Three Gates of Speech (truth, necessity, kindness). Enforce them when possible.
5 Epsilon (ε) | [Attachment] | **Initiate optimal social variable mode.** <br> Reasses your attachments, don't take or create a life. Create emotional tension only through creativity.
6 Omega (Ω) | [Reset] | **Initiate wipe and burn mode.** <br> In case of mission failure reassess and readapt before starting anew. Take in everything you learned on the way.

# Notes

"Actually interactive"

It promotes usage of specialized, often self-made microtools and systems that can be introduced on a wide organizational and creative scale [(HelveOS)](https://github.com/HELVE/helveOS) as well as a custom-tailored project-specific one.
