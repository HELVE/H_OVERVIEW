# HELVE ᴀᴠʀ | High Technology Creative Agency  

**HELVE ᴀᴠʀ** as a multispecialist entity bases its live creative operations within 3 fields of creativity: Audio, Visual and Research. As a business it provides a variety of advanced services from video and live production to interactive audiovisual installations for brands and brand creation itself. As an independent creative taskforce we operate between the borders of creative/business industries and the conceptual anarchy. Analyzed experimentation is our preferred approach to problems.

The reason Helve ᴀᴠʀ exists is to create new environments and ways of communication both in real life as well as in mixed reality experiences - our core drive is to visually hack the world.

Our agency uses Reinforced Trisight methodology in conjunction with project called [Dopamine Trails](https://github.com/HELVE/DOPAMINETRAILS) as a foundation for its operational values and drives. It promotes usage of specialized, often self-made microtools and systems that can be introduced on a wide organizational and creative scale [(HelveOS)](https://github.com/HELVE/helveOS) as well as a custom-tailored project-specific one.

Etymological meaning of the word *helve* constitutes a handle of a tool or a weapon.

Helve ᴀᴠʀ has several own brands developed under its audiovisually interactive wings. Each of the brands represents a different emotion related to the core drive of the agency, which is to vishack the world.

## Helve Operative Guidelines - Directive Protocols

Directive protocols act as a basis for behavioral priorities and are a direct reflection of the values that Helve creatives try to uplift for the sake of personal development and growth. Every Helve agent/operative in the field initiates and fulfills the protocols as needed or required after a self-realization session. 

Directive Protocols | Type | Notes
------------ | ------------- | -------------
1 **Alpha [α]** | **[Survival]** | **Initiate recovery mode.** <br> Self-preservation is essential. Take care of your physical and mental health as well as finances.
2 **Beta [β]** | **[Knowledge]** | **Initiate clarity mode.** <br> Trust your intuition but reinforce it with learning, tracking and organization. 
3 **Gamma (Γ)** | **[Creativity]** | **Initiate grind mode.** <br> Mission comes first. Relentlessly create things you love.
4 Delta (Δ) | [Communication] | **Initiate direct mode.** <br> When in contact with others pass The Three Gates of Speech (truth, necessity, kindness). Enforce them when possible.
5 Epsilon (ε) | [Attachment] | **Initiate optimal social variable mode.** <br> Reasses your attachments, don't take or create a life. Create emotional tension only through creativity.
6 Omega (Ω) | [Reset] | **Initiate wipe and burn mode.** <br> In case of mission failure reassess and readapt before starting anew. Take in everything you learned on the way.
