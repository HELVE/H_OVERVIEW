# HELVE<sup>AVR</sup> | Multispecialist Production Studio 

**HELVE<sup>AVR</sup>** is a multispecialist production studio basing its operations on 3 pillars of creativity: Audio, Visual and Research. Etymological meaning of the word *helve* constitutes a handle of a tool or a weapon. HELVE<sup>AVR</sup> uses the Reinforced Trisight methodology, which at its core condones and promotes usage of microtools both on a wide organization and creative scale [(HelveOS)](https://github.com/HELVE/helveOS) as well as custom-tailored project-specific scale.
