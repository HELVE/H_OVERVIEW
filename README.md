# HELVE AVR | Multispecialist Creative Agency  
"Actually interactive" ;p

**HELVE AVR** as a multispecialist high technology creative agency bases its live creative operations within 3 fields of creativity: Audio, Visual and Research. Etymological meaning of the word *helve* constitutes a handle of a tool or a weapon. As a business it provides a variety of advanced services from video and livestream production to interactive installations for brands and brand creation itself. 

Our agency uses the reinforced trisight methodology, which promotes usage of specialized, often self-made microtools on a wide organizational and creative scale [(HelveOS)](https://github.com/HELVE/helveOS) as well as the custom-tailored project-specific one.

Helve AVR has several own brands developed under its audiovisually interactive wings. Each of the brands represents a different emotion related to the core drive of the agency, which is to vishack the world.

## Helve Operative Guidelines - Directive Protocols

Directive protocols act as a basis for behavioral priorities and are a direct reflection of the values that Helve creatives try to uplift for the sake of personal development and growth. Every Helve agent/operative in the field initiates and fulfills the protocols as needed or required after a self-realization session. 

Directive Protocols | Type | Notes
------------ | ------------- | -------------
1 Alpha [α] | [Survival] | **Initiate recovery mode.** <br> Self-preservation is essential. Take care of your physical and mental health as well as finances.
2 Beta [β] | [Knowledge] | **Initiate clarity mode.** <br> Trust your intuition but reinforce it with learning, tracking and organization. 
3 Gamma (Γ) | [Creativity] | **Initiate grind mode.** <br> Mission comes first. Relentlessly create things you love.
4 Delta (Δ) | [Communication] | **Initiate direct mode.** <br> When in contact with others pass The Three Gates of Speech (truth, necessity, kindness). Enforce them when possible.
5 Epsilon (ε) | [Attachment] | **Initiate optimal social variable mode.** <br> Reasses your attachments, don't take or create a life. Create emotional tension only through creativity.
6 Omega (Ω) | [Reset] | **Initiate wipe and burn mode.** <br> In case of mission failure reassess and readapt before starting anew. Take in everything you learned on the way.
