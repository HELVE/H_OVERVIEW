# HELVE<sup>AVR</sup> | Multispecialist Production Studio  

**HELVE<sup>AVR</sup>** is a multispecialist production studio basing its activities on 3 pillars of creativity: Audio, Visual and Research. Etymological meaning of the word *helve* constitutes a handle of a tool or a weapon. HELVE<sup>AVR</sup> uses the Reinforced Trisight methodology, which at its core condones and promotes usage of microtools both on a wide organization and creative scale [(HelveOS)](https://github.com/HELVE/helveOS) as well as custom-tailored project-specific scale.

## Helve Operative Guidelines

Directive protocols act as a basis for behavioral priorities and are a direct reflection of the values that Helve creatives try to uplift for the sake of personal development and growth. Every Helve agent/operative in the field initiates and fulfills the protocols as needed or required after a self-realization session. 

Directive Protocols | Type | Notes
------------ | ------------- | -------------
1 Alpha [α] | [Survival] | **Initiate recovery mode.** <br> Self-preservation is essential. Take care of your physical and mental health as well as finances.
2 Beta [β] | [Knowledge] | **Initiate clarity mode.** <br> Trust your intuition but reinforce it with learning, tracking and organization. 
3 Gamma (Γ) | [Creativity] | **Initiate grind mode.** <br> Mission comes first. Relentlessly create things you love.
4 Delta (Δ) | [Communication] | **Initiate direct mode.** <br> When in contact with others pass The Three Gates of Speech (truth, necessity, kindness). Enforce them when possible.
5 Epsilon (ε) | [Attachment] | **Initiate optimal social variable mode.** <br> Reasses your attachments, don't take or create a life. Create emotional tension only through creativity.
6 Omega (Ω) | [Reset] | **Initiate wipe and burn mode.** <br> In case of mission failure reassess and readapt before starting anew. Take in everything you learned on the way.
