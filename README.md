REWORK THE INTRO

**HELVE ᴀᴠʀ** is a 2-12 years in the making creative meta entity/manifestation (or hyperbrand/metabrand), which has been my way to clarify who I am as a maker, as a human and what I strive for in life. Helve consists of Operatives who are a multispecialized group of acquainted creatives (world summoners, designers, videographers, musicians, game makers, writers) experimenting with advanced technology and creating new ways of expression in various tech and content outputs. 

As an independent creative taskforce we operate between the borders of creative industries and freedom of conceptual anarchy. Analyzed experimentation is our preferred approach to problems and a form of expression alike. 

The reason Helve ᴀᴠʀ exists is to create not only new ways of expression for us as artists and crafters but also to provide new future environments and ways of communication both in real life and in mixed reality experiences. Our core drive is to **visually hack the world** and promote being creative and proactive with one's life through documenting the process of making something and potentially inspiring others to make their own unusual creative projects - be it a big or small story to tell.

As a service Helve ᴀᴠʀ aims to provide a variety of expertise from video and live production, through design of transmedia narrative engagement of the audience to interactive audiovisual installations for brands and dark moon brand creation itself (*brands inherently rebellious in nature, trying to change the status quo, with preference for persistent small experimental steps and the philosophy that quantity creates quality* - read more about [Helve ᴀᴠʀ Agency Source Code](#sourcecode) below).

Our entity uses Reinforced Trisight methodology - we base our live creative operations within 3 fields of creativity: Audio, Visual & Research/Interaction. Such specific division works in conjunction with a 'life purpose' project initially created for personal use called [Dopamine Trails](https://github.com/HELVE/DOPAMINETRAILS) (function: clarifying ones core drives, discovering strengths and weaknesses, optimizing lifestyle for creativity) and is what makes the foundation for Helve ᴀᴠʀ's operational values. 

## Helve Operative Guidelines - Directive Protocols

Directive Protocols act as a basis for behavioral priorities and are a direct reflection of the values that creatives of Helve try to uplift for the sake of personal development and growth. Every Helve Operative in the field initiates and fulfills the protocols as needed or required after a self-realization session. 

Directive Protocols | Type [Lifeloop] | Notes
------------ | ------------- | -------------
1 **Alpha [α]** | **[Survival]** | **Initiate recovery mode.** <br> Self-preservation is essential. Take care of your physical and mental health as well as finances.
2 **Beta [β]** | **[Knowledge]** | **Initiate clarity mode.** <br> Trust your intuition but reinforce it with learning, tracking and organization. 
3 **Gamma (Γ)** | **[Creativity]** | **Initiate grind mode.** <br> Mission comes first. Relentlessly create things you love.
4 Delta (Δ) | [Communication] | **Initiate direct mode.** <br> When in contact with others pass The Three Gates of Speech (truth, necessity, kindness). Enforce them when possible.
5 Epsilon (ε) | [Attachment] | **Initiate optimal social variable mode.** <br> Reasses your attachments, don't take or create a life. Create emotional tension only through creativity.
6 Omega (Ω) | [Reset] | **Initiate wipe and burn mode.** <br> In case of mission failure reassess and readapt before starting anew. Take in everything you learned on the way.

# Helve ᴀᴠʀ Creative Universe Approach

Helve ᴀᴠʀ as a hyperbrand exisiting both in reality and in the narrative universes has several own dark moon brands developed under its wings. Each of the metabrands represents a range of underlying emotions/motivations/mindstates related to the main core drive of the agency, which is to vishack the world. 

All metabrands are implemented through creation of specific narrative transmedia universes. They are often based on an episodic/seasonal structure as well as rapid prototyping and behind the scenes approach ([Helve Logs - Live Documentation Series](https://github.com/HELVE/HELVELOGS)).

Note: It is easy to create content when you are living the content. The truth costs you nothing, the lies mean effort. Show your truth. Devalue the production quality, upvalue the output.
