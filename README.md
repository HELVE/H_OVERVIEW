# HELVE<sup>AVR</sup> | Multispecialist Production Studio 

**HELVE<sup>AVR</sup>** is a multispecialist production studio basing its activities on 3 pillars of creativity: Audio, Visual and Research. Etymological meaning of the word *helve* constitutes a handle of a tool or a weapon. HELVE<sup>AVR</sup> uses the Reinforced Trisight methodology, which at its core condones and promotes usage of microtools both on a wide organization and creative scale [(HelveOS)](https://github.com/HELVE/helveOS) as well as custom-tailored project-specific scale.

## Helve Operative Guidelines

Directive protocols act as a basis for behavioral priorities and are a direct reflection of the values that Helve creatives try to uplift for the sake of personal development and growth. Every Helve agent/operative in the field initiates and fulfills the protocols as needed or required after a self-realization session. 

Directive Protocols | Tag | Type  | Notes 
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
Alpha | [α] | [Survival] | Initiate recovery mode. Self-preservation is essential. Take care of your health and finances.
Beta | [β] | [Creativity] | Initiate grind mode. Mission comes first. Relentlessly create things whatever they may be.
Gamma | (Γ) | [Clarity] | Initiate clarity mode. Trust your intuition but reinforce it with learning, tracking and organization.
Delta | (Δ) | [Attachment] | Initiate optimal social variable mode. Don't attach yourself, don't take or create a life.
Epsilon | (ε) | [Communication] | Initiate direct mode. When in contact with others pass The Three Gates of Speech. Enforce them when possible.
Omega | (Ω) | [Reset] | Initiate wipe and burn mode. In case of mission failure reassess and readapt before starting anew.
